Determining  the  location  on  the  Irish  National  Grid  is  an  issue  many  people  who  enjoy 
outdoor activities  such as  mountaineering  encounter.  The problem arises  when with the use 
of an ordnance  survey map the exact location of the user cannot be determined. This project 
aims to develop an application to run on Wear OS. The applications is developed on Android 
Studio with the use of the Android Studio Emulator along with a physical smartwatch. The 
main  goal of the application is to have the capabilities to  convert the GPS location coordinates 
to  the coordinates used  in  the Irish National Grid  reference system.  Other features are included 
in  the  application  such  as  a  navigational  feature  that  can  determine  the  distance  from  a 
destination.
